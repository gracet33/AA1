<h1>Project Overview</h1>
Enhancing Customer Churn Prediction in E-commerce

<h2>Objective:</h2>
1. Gain comprehensive insights into customer behavior.

2. Develop and train three models for predictive analysis and conduct a comparative analysis to determine the most effective model.

3. Using data-driven approach to optimize decision-making processes within the business.  

<h2>Tools Utilized:</h2>

<h3>Talend Data Prep:</h3>
Role: Initial data exploration and formatting.  
Functions: Data Profiling, correction of naming inconsistencies, and numerical values formatting, such as rounding up numbers to a precision.   
Significance: Identifying data issues and preparing the dataset for further analysis.  

<h3>Knime:</h3>
Role: Data visualization, exploration, and sampling.  
Functions: Statistical view generation, visualization using a pie chart, and performing equal size sampling to address class imbalance.  
Significance: Initial exploration, confirmation of data characteristics, and sampling to balance the distribution of the target variable, Churn.  

<h3>SAS Enterprise Miner:</h3>
Role: Advanced data exploration, imputation, predictive modeling, and model comparison.  
Functions: Importing, editing, and exploring variables; imputing missing values; analyzing variable associations; and training predictive models.  
Significance: Uncovering in-depth insights into the dataset, addressing missing values, and training models for customer churn prediction.  

<h2>Abstract:</h2>
The case study demonstrates a comprehensive approach to understanding customer behavior in e-commerce through data exploration, modification, and predictive modeling. Gradient Boosting model was identified as the preferred model due to its lower misclassification rates and squared errors on both training and validation sets. Through this case study, we encountered challenges in feature selection. Therefore, for future work, iterative fine-tuning hyperparameters for enhanced model accuracy as wel as exploration of customer behavior analytics using clustering techniques can be attempted to perform a better feature selection of the dataset.
